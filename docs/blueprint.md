# **App Name**: Seoul GLP Tracker

## Core Features:

- Clinic Availability Map: Display GLP-1 clinics (Wegovy, Mounjaro) on a map of Seoul, Bundang, and Dongtan, indicating availability and price. Color-coded markers (green for available, red for unavailable) show clinic status.
- Crowdsourced Data Updates: Allow users to report, modify, and vote on the reliability of clinic information, maintaining an up-to-date database of availability and pricing.
- Availability Prediction: Use an AI tool that predicts the likelihood of a clinic having Wegovy or Mounjaro in stock based on historical data, user reports, and regional trends.  This tool suggests a probability score to surface to the user.
- Real-time Status Aggregation: Aggregate user reports and votes to provide a real-time summary of each clinic's status (availability, price) for Wegovy and Mounjaro.
- User Reporting System: Enable users to submit reports on clinic availability, pricing, and other details via a streamlined form, contributing to the real-time data aggregation.
- Moderation and Verification: Implement a system for community and admin moderation of user reports, ensuring data accuracy and preventing misinformation.
- Interactive Filtering: Provide an interactive filtering panel that allows users to filter clinics by region, product, price range, update date, and verification status.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep teal (#008080) to evoke a sense of trust and health. Avoid cliches like medical greens and blues.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F8FF), a desaturated version of teal, to create a calm and trustworthy environment.
- Accent color: Soft coral (#F08080), an analogous hue, for highlighting key interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' for a clean and modern feel. This sans-serif is suitable for both headlines and body text in short chunks, creating a contemporary look.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent availability and other clinic information. Icons should be easily recognizable and consistent throughout the app.
- Implement a clean, map-centric layout with a filtering panel on the left. The map should be prominent and interactive.
- Use subtle animations for map marker updates and filtering transitions. Animations should enhance the user experience without being distracting.
